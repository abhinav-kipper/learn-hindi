## Schema (Lesson JSON)

```ts
{
  id: string
  title: string
  situation: string
  skills: string[]
  phrases: { hindi, english, context, pronunciation }[]
  grammar_notes: string[]
  culture_notes: string[]
  skill_breakdown: { skill, explanation, more_examples: { hindi, english }[] }[]
  practice_prompt: string         // sent to Gemini as scenario for chat practice
  references: string[]            // REQUIRED: textbooks/sources consulted when authoring
}
```

## Pedagogical references

When sourcing/authoring lessons we consult (without copying) these renowned references:

- **Snell & Weightman, *Teach Yourself Hindi*** — gold standard for spoken-style pedagogy and grammar sequencing
- **R.S. McGregor, *Outline of Hindi Grammar*** — academic-grade grammar reference
- **Afroz Taj, *A Door Into Hindi* (UNC)** — free university course with hospitality / cultural modules
- **NCERT Hindi textbooks** — Indian school curriculum, free PDFs

The actual phrases/examples in our lessons are written originally in our app's voice — we draw on these for sequencing, grammar accuracy, and pedagogical structure only. Lessons store consulted sources in their `references` array.

## Style Guide

### Register policy

- **Default**: `aap` (respectful). Shopkeepers, auto drivers, strangers, elders, anyone you're not close with.
- **Friendly/peer scenarios**: `tum` (chai with a mate, classmates, weekend plans).
- **Intimate only**: `tu` (sibling teasing, very close friend on WhatsApp, anger). Use sparingly.
- **Teaching exceptions**: `01-greetings` and `06-pronouns-verbs` explicitly teach the 3-way contrast; `tu` phrases in those lessons MUST be tagged "(very informal)" or "(intimate)" in the `english` field.
- The practice tutor (`/practice/<id>`) flags register-mismatches as corrections. Authored content must never model those mismatches.

### Conversational, not bookish

- Use natural fillers and softeners: `arrey`, `accha`, `matlab`, `yaar`, `dekho`, `bas`, `haan`, `na`.
- Use contractions and dropped pronouns where Hindi naturally does.
- Avoid textbook connectives in phrases: `iss prakar`, `isliye`, `parantu`, `kintu`. Those belong in `grammar_notes` only.
- 2-3 Hindi sentences per phrase MAX. Often one is best.

### Romanization rules

- ASCII only. NO Devanagari script in JSON content (the practice tutor enforces this on AI output).
- Single-vowel endings: `karta` not `kartaa`, `karunga` not `karoongaa`.
- `chh` for छ (`chhat` not `cchat`).
- `dh` for ध, `th` for थ.
- `aa` only when ambiguity matters (`haan` vs `han`).

### Pronunciation field

- SYLLABLE-stress format. Hyphens between syllables. CAPS on the stressed syllable.
- Example: `BA-zaar ja-NA hai`, `na-mas-TE AUN-ty ji`.
- Consistent across all lessons (some older lessons use a different style — fix as you encounter them).

### Gender-aware examples

- Where verb endings differ by speaker gender, show both: `main jaa raha hoon / jaa rahi hoon`.
- For single-form examples (when only one gender is shown), use **feminine** (`-i`, `-rahi`, `-gayi`) since the app defaults users to female gender.
- The practice tutor uses the stored user gender to give correct agreement; authored examples must not contradict this.

### Structure & length

- 8-10 phrases per lesson.
- Each phrase has `hindi`, `english`, `context`, `pronunciation`.
- `context`: 1-2 sentences. The conversational beat + social signal.
- `grammar_notes`: 3-5 notes. Focus on the new rule the lesson teaches.
- `culture_notes`: 2-4 notes. Practical social-dynamic tips, not generic facts.
- `skill_breakdown`: 2-3 entries. Each: `skill`, `explanation` (1-2 sentences), `more_examples` (3-5 `{hindi, english}` pairs).
- `practice_prompt`: 1-2 sentences setting the scene for the Gemini tutor.
- `references`: REQUIRED, at least one entry like `"Snell & Weightman Ch. 11"` or `"Afroz Taj Lesson 9"`.

## Canonical Sources

All new content must cite at least one of these. McGregor is a grammar reference only — don't lift phrases from it.

### Snell & Weightman — Teach Yourself Hindi
22 chapters, grammar-progressive with dialogues. Free PDF on archive.org. Use for grammar accuracy, scenario inspiration, idiomatic patterns. Dialogues lean slightly formal — soften them for conversational tone.

### Afroz Taj — A Door Into Hindi
24 video lessons with transcripts at `taj.oasis.unc.edu` (UNC Chapel Hill, free). Use for conversational tone, North Indian register, scenario authenticity. Phrases are usually drop-in usable.

### McGregor — Outline of Hindi Grammar
Oxford University Press. Reference ONLY for grammar disambiguation when Snell & Weightman is unclear. Never lift phrases — McGregor is academic-formal.

## Authoring Workflow

Step-by-step for adding a new lesson:

1. Pick a topic from `content/lesson-queue.json` (or add one with `id`, `title`, `scenario`, `skills`, `level`, `references`).
2. Pick the source chapter(s) — at least one from Snell & Weightman or Afroz Taj.
3. Draft the lesson JSON:
   - **AI-assisted**: `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=… node scripts/generate-lesson.mjs --topic=<id>` — generates a draft using the updated `STYLE_GUIDE`.
   - **Hand-authored**: write `content/lessons/NN-<id>.json` following the schema; use the next available `NN`.
4. Review against the style guide above (register, conversational, pronunciation, gender, references[]).
5. Register in `lib/lessons.ts`:
   - Add the import at the top.
   - Add the named export to the `lessons` array (in order).
6. Update the Inventory table in this file (`CONTENT.md`).
7. Pop the topic from `content/lesson-queue.json`.
8. Validate locally:
   ```bash
   npx vitest run
   npx tsc --noEmit
   node scripts/lint-design.mjs
   ```
9. Commit: `content(hindi): add <topic> lesson — <source citation>`

## Known Issues (as of 2026-05-26)

### Bugs (fixed)
- ~~Typo `chahat pe` → `chhat pe` in `05-postpositions.json`~~ ✓
- ~~Wrong "you" register `tere paas` → `tumhare paas` in `01-greetings.json` phrase 7~~ ✓
- ~~Hindi situation lessons mixed `tum`-default with `aap`-default registers~~ — new lessons (08-10) all use aap-default per the practice tutor's policy; generator's STYLE_GUIDE flipped to enforce.
- ~~`lib/dutch/level-map.ts` used bare IDs that never matched lesson JSONs~~ — fixed to use `dutch-` prefixed keys; 3-stage progress bars on Dutch home now compute correctly.

### Romanization & style inconsistency (not yet addressed)
- Mixed stress system in older Hindi lesson JSONs: sometimes CAPS-on-stressed-syllable (`BHAI-ya`), sometimes just hyphens for syllables (`KIT-ne`). New lessons (08-10 + foundations 08-09) use SYLLABLE-stress consistently. Older lessons need a pass.
- `cc` vs `chh` convention not documented in-content (style guide above defines it).
- Pronunciation field formatting varies file to file.

### Structural gaps
- ~~**Foundations have empty `skill_breakdown: []`**~~ — RESOLVED 2026-05-26. All 9 Hindi foundations now have 3 skill_breakdowns each.
- ~~**No level markers** — no A1/A2/B1 progression~~ — RESOLVED for Dutch (Lesson type has `level?` field; all Dutch lessons tagged via JSON + `lib/dutch/level-map.ts`). Hindi has no CEFR system intentionally.
- **No audio assets** — TTS via `lib/speech.ts` works, but no native recordings. Most relevant for Dutch Phase 3 Luisteren when it ships.
- **Scope is still growing** — Hindi: 10 situations + 9 foundations + 100 vocab. Dutch: 11 lessons + 7 foundations + 100 KNM + 10 Lezen texts. The grow-vs-polish balance is currently leaning grow.

## Dutch — Exam-Prep Track (Inburgeringsexamen B1 + KNM)

### Target exam
Inburgeringsexamen B1 + KNM. HSM holders need this (or equivalent) to naturalize for the Dutch passport.

### Strategic framework
A1 (months 1-2) → A2 (months 3-5) → B1 (months 6-9). A2 = optional stop-out (settings toggle in welcome modal).

### UI language
All UI/labels in English. Dutch only for: KNM question text, Chaina voice lines, italic Dutch-skill-name subtitles (Lezen / Luisteren / Schrijven / Spreken) for exposure-learning.

**Bilingual study mode:** KNM study cards now show English under Dutch (drill stays Dutch-only for exam realism). Lezen study mode renders Dutch body + English translation toggle + bilingual MCQs; the timed mock is Dutch-only.

### Content inventory
| Track | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Lessons (A1-A2) | 5 existing | supermarket, introductions, cafe, doctor, transport |
| Foundations (A1-A2) | 7 existing | numbers, pronunciation, present, de/het, word-order, past, modals |
| KNM | 100 questions, 6 categories | Phase 1 (shipped 2026-05-26) |
| Lezen (Reading) | 10 texts (5 A1 + 4 A2 + 1 B1), 40 MCQs, bilingual study mode | Phase 2 (shipped 2026-05-26) |
| Luisteren (Listening) | not yet | Phase 3 |
| Schrijven (Writing) | not yet | Phase 4 |
| Spreken (Speaking) | not yet | Phase 5 |
